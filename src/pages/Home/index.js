          <h2>Welcome to the ERC20 Certificates √êapp</h2>
          <p>
            The ERC20 Certificate Token is a solidity smart contract extension of the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md">ERC20 Token Standard</a> which adds the ability for contract owners and their delegates to create and sign redeemable certificates without needing to create an on-chain transaction.
          </p>
          <h2>Why?</h2>
          <p>
           The concept of certificates can be applied to many use cases, for instance a Dapp creator who would like to distribute tokens as a reward but does not want to have to worry about paying the transaction fees for each and every token transfer. By signing a certificate, he now places the burden of creating the transaction to transfer the token on the redeemer.
          </p>
          <h2>How can I experiment with this?</h2>
          <p>
          This Dapp was created to allow experimentation with ERC20 Token Certificates. You can use this site to:
